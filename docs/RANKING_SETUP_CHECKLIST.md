## üîç Troubleshooting

### OCR Not Working
**Problem:** "Tesseract not found" error

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Tesseract installed: `tesseract --version`
2. Check PATH includes Tesseract directory
3. Restart terminal/IDE after installation
4. Try absolute path in code if needed

### Channel Restriction Not Working
**Problem:** Can submit in wrong channels

**Solutions:**
1. Check RANKINGS_CHANNEL_ID in `.env`
2. Verify ID is correct (right-click ‚Üí Copy ID)
3. Restart bot after .env changes
4. Check bot has READ_MESSAGES permission

### No Modlog Messages
**Problem:** Admin notifications not appearing

**Solutions:**
1. Check channel named "modlog" exists OR
2. Set MODLOG_CHANNEL_ID in `.env`
3. Verify bot has SEND_MESSAGES + EMBED_LINKS permissions
4. Check bot can see modlog channel

### Commands Not Appearing
**Problem:** `/games ranking` not showing

**Solutions:**
1. Verify cog loaded in `integration_loader.py`
2. Check for startup errors: `python -m discord_bot.main`
3. Sync commands: `python sync_commands.py`
4. Wait 1-5 minutes for Discord to update

### Duplicate Detection Issues
**Problem:** Duplicate submissions allowed

**Solutions:**
1. Check database constraints exist
2. Verify event_week calculation correct
3. Check UNIQUE constraint in schema:
   ```sql
   UNIQUE(user_id, guild_id, event_week, stage_type, day_number)
   ```

## üìä Database Management

### View Rankings
```powershell
sqlite3 event_rankings.db
SELECT * FROM event_rankings ORDER BY submitted_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Check Current Week
```sql
SELECT event_week, COUNT(*) as submissions 
FROM event_rankings 
GROUP BY event_week 
ORDER BY event_week DESC;
```

### View Statistics
```sql
SELECT 
    guild_tag,
    COUNT(*) as total_submissions,
    AVG(rank) as avg_rank,
    MAX(score) as highest_score
FROM event_rankings
WHERE event_week = '2025-43'
GROUP BY guild_tag;
```

### Cleanup Old Data
```sql
-- Automatic cleanup in code, or manual:
DELETE FROM event_rankings 
WHERE submitted_at < datetime('now', '-30 days');
```
