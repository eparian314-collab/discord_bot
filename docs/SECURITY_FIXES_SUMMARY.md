# Security Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document tracks security improvements and exploit mitigations implemented to prevent cookie farming and system abuse.

## Issues Fixed

### ‚úÖ 1. Easter Egg Game Exploits (FIXED)

**Problem:**
- Users could trigger multiple easter eggs without completing games
- RPS game didn't show correct command format
- Users could spam easter eggs for unlimited cookies

**Solution:**
- Modified easter egg flow to defer cookie rewards until game completion
- Updated RPS command to show correct `/fun rps` format
- Games now use `award_cookies_now=False` flag on trigger
- Cookies only awarded when games are completed successfully

**Files Changed:**
- `cogs/easteregg_cog.py` (lines 185, 193-199, 227-247)

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Trivia/Riddle Daily Limit Bypass (FIXED)

**Problem:**
- Trivia and riddle answer handlers used `try_award_cookies()` instead of `try_award_easter_egg_cookies()`
- This bypassed the 5 cookies/day limit for easter eggs
- Users could farm unlimited cookies by answering trivia/riddles

**Solution:**
- Changed trivia handler (line 660) to use `try_award_easter_egg_cookies()`
- Changed riddle handler (line 677) to use `try_award_easter_egg_cookies()`
- Now properly enforces daily easter egg limit
- Shows progress counter: `(X/5 daily cookies)`

**Files Changed:**
- `cogs/easteregg_cog.py` (lines 644-688)

---

### ‚úÖ 3. SOS Spam Prevention (FIXED)

**Problem:**
- No rate limiting on SOS alerts
- Users could spam @everyone alerts
- Could be used to harass server members

**Solution:**
- Added 15-minute cooldown between SOS triggers per user
- Cooldown tracked in `InputEngine._sos_cooldowns` dictionary
- User receives message with remaining time if cooldown active
- Format: "‚è≥ Please wait Xm Ys before sending another SOS alert."

**Files Changed:**
- `core/engines/input_engine.py`:
  - Added `SOS_COOLDOWN_SECONDS = 900` constant (line ~37)
  - Added `_sos_cooldowns: Dict[int, float]` tracking dict (line ~81)
  - Added cooldown check in `_trigger_sos()` method (lines 291-320)

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Battle Spam Prevention (FIXED)

**Problem:**
- No cooldown on battle starts
- Users could spam battle challenges
- Could be used to drain opponent cookies repeatedly

**Solution:**
- Added 5-minute cooldown between battle starts per user
- Cooldown tracked in `BattleCog._battle_cooldowns` dictionary
- User receives message with remaining time if cooldown active
- Format: "‚è≥ Please wait Xm Ys before starting another battle!"
- Cooldown timestamp set when battle successfully created

**Files Changed:**
- `cogs/battle_cog.py`:
  - Added `time` import (line 14)
  - Added `BATTLE_COOLDOWN_SECONDS = 300` constant (line 47)
  - Added `_battle_cooldowns: Dict[str, float]` tracking dict (line 56)
  - Added cooldown check in `battle_start()` command (lines 170-182)
  - Set cooldown on battle creation (line 274)

## Remaining Considerations

### üü° Training Cog Duplication

**Status:** Not yet addressed - user wants to keep training feature

**Issue:**
- `cogs/training_cog.py` is loaded but duplicates functionality in `cogs/game_cog.py`
- Training is fully implemented in game_cog.py (lines 675-730) with proper protections
- Loading both creates duplicate `/train` command
- Old training_cog uses deprecated StorageEngine instead of GameStorageEngine

**Options:**
1. Remove training_cog from `integrations/integration_loader.py` (line 581)
2. Rewrite training_cog to use proper systems (attempted but user undid)
3. Leave as-is if game_cog training is working correctly

**Recommendation:** Remove training_cog from loader to avoid confusion

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test easter egg RPS with correct command format
- [ ] Verify trivia daily limit (should stop at 5 cookies/day)
- [ ] Verify riddle daily limit (should stop at 5 cookies/day)
- [ ] Test SOS cooldown (15 minutes between alerts)
- [ ] Test battle cooldown (5 minutes between starts)
- [ ] Verify cookie rewards show progress counter
- [ ] Test that easter egg spam penalties still work
- [ ] Verify aggravation resets on correct answers

## Security Best Practices

### Rate Limiting Pattern
```python
# Standard cooldown implementation
cooldowns: Dict[int, float] = {}
COOLDOWN_SECONDS = 300

current_time = time.time()
if user_id in cooldowns:
    time_since_last = current_time - cooldowns[user_id]
    if time_since_last < COOLDOWN_SECONDS:
        remaining = int(COOLDOWN_SECONDS - time_since_last)
        # Inform user and return
        return

# Set cooldown on successful action
cooldowns[user_id] = current_time
```

### Cookie Reward Pattern
```python
# For easter eggs - enforces daily limits
cookies = cookie_manager.try_award_easter_egg_cookies(user_id, mood)
if cookies:
    can_continue, cookies_today = cookie_manager.check_easter_egg_limit(user_id)
    progress = f" ({cookies_today}/{MAX_DAILY_EASTER_EGG_COOKIES} daily cookies)"
    # Show progress to user

# For gameplay - different limits/rules
cookies = cookie_manager.try_award_cookies(user_id, action_type, mood)
```

### Session Cleanup Pattern
```python
# Clean up sessions on completion
if user_id in active_sessions:
    del active_sessions[user_id]
    
# Reset aggravation on successful interaction
if storage:
    storage.reset_aggravation(user_id)
```
