## 🎮 Game Flow

### Phase 1: Cookie Collection
1. User interacts with bot (translations, easter eggs, etc.)
2. Bot randomly awards cookies based on:
   - Action type and drop rate
   - Relationship level (affects drop rate)
   - Bot mood (affects amount)
3. User checks progress with `/check_cookies`

### Phase 2: Game Unlock
1. User accumulates 5 cookies
2. Uses `/feed` to feed Baby Hippo
3. Game unlocks with tutorial message
4. Pokemon commands become available

### Phase 3: Pokemon Game
1. **Catching**:
   - `/catch` (2 🍪) - Common/uncommon Pokemon
   - `/fish` (2 🍪) - Water types with rare chances
   - `/explore` (3 🍪) - Rare/legendary Pokemon
   - Max 3 of each species

2. **Training**:
   - `/train <id> <cookies>` - Spend cookies for XP
   - XP amount based on luck (relationship)
   - Pokemon level up over time

3. **Evolution**:
   - Requires 2+ of same species
   - `/evolve <id> <duplicate_id>`
   - Consumes duplicate + cookies
   - Creates evolved form with boosted stats

4. **Collection**:
   - `/collection` - View all Pokemon
   - Organized by species
   - Shows level and XP

## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

1. **Relationship System**: Encourages daily engagement with decay mechanics
2. **Cookie Economy**: Balances earning and spending for progression
3. **Luck System**: Rewards loyal users with better outcomes
4. **Species Limit**: Prevents inventory bloat, encourages evolution
5. **Mood System**: Adds personality and unpredictability
6. **OpenAI Integration**: Dynamic responses scale with user relationship
7. **Stamina Costs**: Cookies serve dual purpose (currency + stamina)
8. **Command Guards**: Game features hidden until unlocked

## 🐛 Edge Cases Handled

1. **Insufficient Cookies**: Clear error messages, balance checks
2. **Species Limit**: Catch attempts fail gracefully with explanation
3. **Evolution Requirements**: Multiple validation checks
4. **Relationship Decay**: Only after 3 days of inactivity
5. **Database Errors**: Transactions with rollback support
6. **API Failures**: Fallback to hardcoded content
7. **OpenAI Unavailable**: Static personality responses
8. **Duplicate Detection**: Proper Pokemon ID tracking
9. **SOS DM Failures**: Graceful handling of blocked/disabled DMs
10. **Translation Failures**: Fallback to original English message
11. **Missing Language Roles**: Skip users without roles

## 📈 Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Battle System**: PvP and PvE battles
2. **Trading**: Pokemon trading between users
3. **Leaderboards**: Top collectors, trainers
4. **Events**: Seasonal Pokemon appearances
5. **Achievements**: Badge system for milestones
6. **Quests**: Daily/weekly challenges
7. **Shinies**: Rare color variants
8. **Moves**: Pokemon move system
