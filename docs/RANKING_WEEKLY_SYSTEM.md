# 🎯 Top Heroes Ranking System - Enhanced with Weekly Tracking

## Major Updates

### ✅ Event Week Tracking
- **Automatic weekly reset**: System tracks events by ISO week (Monday-Sunday)
- **Format**: `YYYY-WW` (e.g., "2025-43")
- **New event detection**: After 2+ weeks, automatically creates new event week
- **Historical data**: Keeps last 4 weeks of rankings by default

### ✅ Dedicated Rankings Channel
- **Channel restriction**: Submissions ONLY allowed in configured rankings channel
- **Environment variable**: `RANKINGS_CHANNEL_ID` in `.env`
- **Clear error messages**: Users redirected to correct channel if they try elsewhere
- **Keeps rankings organized**: All event data in one dedicated channel

### ✅ Duplicate Detection & Updates
- **Smart duplicate checking**: Detects if user already submitted for that day/stage/week
- **Auto-update**: Allows users to resubmit improved rankings
- **Shows improvements**: Displays rank/score changes when updating
- **Prevents confusion**: Clear warnings about replacing existing data

### ✅ Enhanced Validation
- **Data matching**: Verifies screenshot data matches user's selected day/stage
- **Detailed error messages**: Tells users exactly what's wrong
- **Visual guides**: Shows what screenshot needs to include
- **Smart fallbacks**: Helpful tips for better screenshots

## How Event Weeks Work

### Event Schedule
```
Week Structure (7 days):
- Monday-Friday: Days 1-5 (Event days)
- Saturday: Day 6 (War/Fighting day)
- Sunday: Rest/preparation for next week
```

### Week Tracking
- **Start of week**: Monday at 00:00 UTC
- **Current week**: Auto-detected from submission date
- **Week boundaries**: ISO 8601 standard (Monday = week start)
- **Automatic rollover**: New submissions after Sunday create new event week

### Example Timeline
```
Week 2025-43 (Oct 21-27):
  Mon Oct 21 - Day 1 submissions
  Tue Oct 22 - Day 2 submissions
  Wed Oct 23 - Day 3 submissions
  Thu Oct 24 - Day 4 submissions
  Fri Oct 25 - Day 5 submissions
  Sat Oct 26 - War day (Day 6)
  Sun Oct 27 - Rest day

Week 2025-44 (Oct 28 - Nov 3):
  Mon Oct 28 - NEW EVENT WEEK starts
  [Process repeats]
```

## Duplicate Handling

### When User Submits Duplicate
1. ✅ System checks: User ID + Guild + Week + Stage + Day
2. ⚠️ If found: Shows existing submission with rank/score
3. 📊 Compares: Old vs new data
4. 🔄 Updates: Replaces old with new submission
5. 📈 Shows improvement: Rank gained/lost, score difference

### Example Flow
```
User submits Day 1 Prep:
  First time: ✅ Saved as new ranking
  
User submits Day 1 Prep again (same week):
  System: "⚠️ You already submitted Day 1 Prep!"
  Shows: "Your current: Rank #10435, Score 28M"
  Action: Processes new screenshot
  Result: "📈 Improvement: +50 ranks, +2M points"
  Updates: Replaces old data
```

## Channel Configuration

### Setup Requirements

1. **Create dedicated channel** in Discord (e.g., `#event-rankings`)
2. **Get channel ID** (right-click → Copy ID, dev mode must be on)
3. **Add to `.env`**:
   ```env
   RANKINGS_CHANNEL_ID=1234567890123456789
   ```

### User Experience

#### Correct Channel
```
User in #event-rankings:
/games ranking submit → ✅ Works!
```

#### Wrong Channel
```
User in #general:
/games ranking submit → ❌ Blocked

Bot responds:
"📊 Rankings submissions can only be done in #event-rankings!

This keeps all event rankings organized in one place.
Please go to #event-rankings to submit your screenshot."
```

#### No Channel Configured
```
User anywhere:
/games ranking submit → ❌ Blocked

Bot responds:
"❌ Rankings channel not configured!
Please ask a server admin to set RANKINGS_CHANNEL_ID in the bot's .env file."
```

## Error Handling

### Invalid Screenshot
```
❌ Screenshot validation failed:
Could not read text from image. Please provide a clearer screenshot.

Please make sure your screenshot shows:
• Stage type (Prep/War Stage button)
• Day number (1-5 buttons with one highlighted)
• Your rank (e.g., #10435)
• Your score (e.g., 28,200,103 points)
• Your player name with guild tag (e.g., [TAO] Mars)
```

### Data Mismatch
```
User selects: Day 1, Prep Stage
Screenshot shows: Day 2, Prep Stage

⚠️ Data mismatch!
You selected Day 1, but the screenshot appears to show Day 2.
Please check your screenshot and try again.
```

### Wrong File Type
```
User uploads PDF:

❌ Please upload an image file (PNG, JPG, etc.)!
```

### File Too Large
```
User uploads 15MB image:

❌ Image too large! Please upload a screenshot under 10MB.
```

## Database Changes

### Updated Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE event_rankings (
    ...existing columns...
    event_week TEXT NOT NULL,  -- NEW: "YYYY-WW" format
    ...
    UNIQUE(user_id, guild_id, event_week, stage_type, day_number)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_rankings_event_week 
ON event_rankings(event_week, guild_id);
```

## Data Lifecycle

### Automatic Cleanup
```python
# Delete old event weeks (keeps last 4 weeks = ~1 month)
storage.delete_old_event_weeks(weeks_to_keep=4)
```

# Delete specific old weeks
storage.delete_old_rankings(days=30)
```

3. Fresh start for new event tracking

### Backup Command
```bash
# Before upgrading
cp event_rankings.db event_rankings.db.backup
```
