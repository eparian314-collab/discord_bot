# Pokemon Details System Implementation

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive Pokemon details system implemented to enhance the Pokemon game with full battle-ready functionality including moves, custom nicknames, detailed stats display, and auto-numbering.

## Features Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Move System
- **Database Schema**: Added `moves` column to `pokemon` table (TEXT, stores JSON array)
- **API Integration**: Enhanced `PokemonAPIIntegration` with:
  - `get_pokemon_moves(pokemon_name, level)` - Fetches level-appropriate moves
  - `get_move_details(move_name)` - Gets power, accuracy, PP, type, damage class
  - Move caching to reduce API calls
- **Data Manager**: `PokemonDataManager.generate_moves()` selects 4 best moves based on level
- **Storage**: Moves stored as JSON string, helper methods added for retrieval/update

### 2. ‚úÖ Auto-Numbering System
- Pokemon automatically named with pattern: `{Species} #{number}` (e.g., "Pikachu #1", "Pikachu #2")
- Counts existing Pokemon of same species to generate unique number
- Implemented in `pokemon_game.py` `attempt_catch()` method
- Uses `get_pokemon_count_by_species()` to track duplicates

### 3. ‚úÖ Custom Nickname on Catch
- **Modal Interface**: `PokemonNicknameModal` class for text input
- **Button View**: `PokemonNicknameView` with two options:
  - "‚úèÔ∏è Customize Name" - Opens modal for custom input
  - "‚úÖ Keep Default Name" - Keeps auto-numbered name
- Shown immediately after successful catch
- 20 character limit on nicknames
- Blank input keeps default name

### 4. ‚úÖ Rename Command
- **Command**: `/games pokemon rename <pokemon_id> <new_name>`
- **Validation**:
  - Pokemon must exist
  - Pokemon must belong to user
  - Name must be 1-20 characters
- **Storage**: Uses `update_pokemon_nickname()` helper method

### 5. ‚úÖ Details Command
- **Command**: `/games pokemon details <pokemon_id>`
- **Displays**:
  - Nickname, species, level, nature
  - Full stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Sp.Atk, Sp.Def, Speed)
  - IVs for all stats (x/31) with percentage
  - All 4 moves with name, type, and power
  - Experience points
  - Pokemon ID
- **Formatting**: Rich embed with organized sections

### 6. ‚úÖ Storage Layer Updates
- Added `moves` column to Pokemon table schema
- `add_pokemon()` now accepts `moves` parameter (JSON string)
- `update_pokemon_stats()` includes 'moves' in valid stats
- New helper methods:
  - `update_pokemon_moves(pokemon_id, moves_json)`
  - `update_pokemon_nickname(pokemon_id, nickname)`

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes

```sql
ALTER TABLE pokemon ADD COLUMN moves TEXT;
```

### Move Data Format (JSON)

```json
[
  {
    "name": "thunderbolt",
    "type": "electric",

    "accuracy": 100,
    "pp": 15,
    "damage_class": "special"
  },
  // ... 3 more moves
]
```

### Dependency Injection

Updated `integration_loader.py` to pass `PokemonAPIIntegration` to `PokemonDataManager`:

```python
self.pokemon_api = PokemonAPIIntegration()
self.pokemon_data_manager = PokemonDataManager(
    cache_file="pokemon_base_stats_cache.json",
    api_integration=self.pokemon_api
)
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Database migration successful
- [x] Bot starts without errors
- [x] Commands sync properly
- [x] Auto-numbering works correctly
- [ ] Catch flow with nickname modal (needs Discord testing)
- [ ] Rename command (needs Discord testing)
- [ ] Details command shows moves correctly (needs Discord testing)
