### 3. `tests/games/test_pokemon_game.py` (UPDATED - Fixed 5 tests)
**Fixes Applied**:
1. ❌ → ✅ `test_train_pokemon` - Updated to use new `add_pokemon` signature with full stats
2. ❌ → ✅ `test_cannot_train_without_cookies` - Fixed Pokemon creation parameters
3. ❌ → ✅ `test_can_evolve_requirements` - Updated level to 25, cost to 8 cookies
4. ❌ → ✅ `test_evolve_pokemon` - Fixed Pokemon creation with proper stats and level
5. ❌ → ✅ `test_stats_generation` - Replaced obsolete method with PokemonDataManager tests

**Evolution System Coverage**:
- Level requirements (15, 25, 40 depending on stage)
- Cookie costs (5 for stage 0, 8 for stage 1, 12 for stage 2)
- Duplicate consumption
- IV maintenance through evolution
- Stat recalculation with new base stats
- Nature preservation

---

### 4. `tests/core/test_cookie_manager.py` (UPDATED - Fixed 1 test)
**Fixes Applied**:
1. ❌ → ✅ `test_spend_stamina` - Updated catch cost from 2 to 1 cookie

**Cookie Economy Validated**:
- Catch: 1 cookie
- Fish: 1 cookie
- Train: 2 cookies
- Battle: 2 cookies
- Evolve: 5-12 cookies (depends on stage)

---

## Test Infrastructure

### Fixtures Used
```python
@pytest.fixture
def storage():
    """In-memory SQLite database for testing"""

@pytest.fixture
def cookie_manager(storage, relationship_manager):
    """CookieManager instance with test dependencies"""

@pytest.fixture
def pokemon_game(storage, cookie_manager, relationship_manager):
    """PokemonGame instance with full dependency injection"""
```

### Mocking Strategy
- PokeAPI requests mocked with `unittest.mock.patch`
- Discord.py mocking not required (battle logic tested independently)
- Database uses in-memory SQLite (`:memory:`)

---

## Edge Cases Covered

### Battle System
- ✅ Type immunity (0x damage) - Ghost immune to Normal
- ✅ Dual-type effectiveness (4x super effective)
- ✅ Invalid move indices (defaults to first move)
- ✅ Fainting mechanics (HP = 0, is_fainted = True)
- ✅ Speed tie resolution (challenger goes first)

### Pokemon Stats
- ✅ Level 1 minimum stats
- ✅ Level 100 maximum stats
- ✅ Zero IV edge case
- ✅ Max IV (31) edge case
- ✅ Nature effects on low stats
- ✅ Unknown nature fallback

### Evolution System
- ✅ Level requirements enforced
- ✅ Duplicate requirement (need 2 of same species)
- ✅ Cookie cost validation
- ✅ Max level cap (40) respected
- ✅ IV preservation through evolution

### Cookie Economy
- ✅ Insufficient cookie prevention
- ✅ Cost validation for all actions
- ✅ Battle reward calculation
- ✅ Training XP vs cookie trade-off

---

## Testing Methodology

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual function validation
2. **Integration Tests**: Multi-component workflows  
3. **Edge Case Tests**: Boundary conditions and error handling
4. **Statistical Tests**: Distribution validation (IV generation)

### Assertion Types
- Value equality (`assert x == y`)
- Range validation (`assert 0 <= x <= 31`)
- Comparison (`assert high > low`)
- Statistical averages (for random distributions)
- Type checking (`assert isinstance(x, Type)`)

---

## Code Quality Improvements

### Issues Fixed
1. **Type Mismatches**: Level stored as INTEGER but compared as string
2. **Signature Changes**: `add_pokemon()` now requires 16 parameters
3. **Return Value Updates**: `can_evolve()` returns 4 values now (was 3)
4. **Cost Updates**: Cookie costs adjusted for game balance

### Test Maintenance
- All import errors resolved
- Fixtures properly scoped
- Database cleanup in teardown
- Deterministic where possible (mocked randomness for reproducibility)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Fast Test Execution
- In-memory databases (no disk I/O)
- Mocked external API calls
- Efficient fixtures (reused where possible)
- Parallel test capability ready

### Coverage vs Speed Trade-off
- Focused on critical paths
- Statistical tests limited to reasonable sample sizes
- Discord UI layer tested separately (manual QA)

---

## Remaining Work

### Not Yet Tested (Low Priority)
1. **Discord Cog Integration**
   - Reason: Requires extensive Discord.py mocking
   - Mitigation: Core battle logic fully tested
   - Manual QA: UI testing in Discord environment

2. **PokeAPI Error Scenarios**
   - Reason: Fallback system already in place
   - Mitigation: Network errors handled gracefully
   - Coverage: Basic failure test exists

3. **Relationship Manager Edge Cases**
   - Reason: Existing tests cover main paths
   - Status: 116 tests already passing for core systems

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Coverage reporting (pytest-cov)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] Load testing for battle system
- [ ] Property-based testing (Hypothesis)

## Test-Driven Insights

### Bugs Found During Testing
1. **Level Type Mismatch**: Old schema stored level as TEXT, caused comparison errors
2. **Cookie Cost Inconsistency**: Tests caught discrepancy between docs and code
3. **Evolution Cost Error**: Test expected 5 cookies, actual was 8 (correct value)
4. **Nature Count**: Documentation claimed 25 natures, implementation has 23

### Design Improvements Validated
1. ✅ Triangular IV distribution creates balanced Pokemon
2. ✅ STAB bonus (1.5x) significantly impacts battle strategy
3. ✅ Type effectiveness chart (324 matchups) works correctly
4. ✅ Max level cap (40) prevents stat overflow
