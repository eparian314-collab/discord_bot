# 🎮 Top Heroes Ranking System - Implementation Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Built

Your Discord bot now has a **complete screenshot-based ranking submission system** for Top Heroes events!

### Core Features

1. **📸 Screenshot Processing** (`core/engines/screenshot_processor.py`)
   - OCR technology extracts data from images
   - Identifies: Stage, Day, Rank, Score, Player Name, Guild Tag
   - Smart validation to prevent bad submissions

2. **💾 Database Storage** (`core/engines/ranking_storage_engine.py`)
   - Stores all ranking submissions
   - Tracks submission history
   - Provides leaderboard queries
   - Logs all submission attempts

3. **🤖 Discord Commands** (`cogs/ranking_cog.py`)
   - `/games ranking submit` - Submit screenshots
   - `/games ranking view` - View your history
   - `/games ranking leaderboard` - Guild rankings

## 📋 Event Categories

The system properly tracks the 5 event days:

| Day | Category |
|-----|----------|
| 1 | Construction Day |
| 2 | Research Day |
| 3 | Resource and Mob Day |
| 4 | Hero Day |
| 5 | Troop Training Day |

## 🏷️ Guild Tag System

- Extracts 3-letter guild tags from player names (e.g., **[TAO]** Mars)
- Default filter: TAO guild members
- Future-ready: Can filter by any guild tag
- Stores both Discord username and in-game player name

## 🎯 What Gets Extracted

From your screenshots, the bot automatically reads:

```
✅ Stage Type: Prep Stage or War Stage
✅ Day Number: 1-5 (shown as highlighted buttons)
✅ Category: Auto-mapped from day number
✅ Rank: #10435 (overall rank with symbol)
✅ Score: 28,200,103 (points with commas)
✅ Guild Tag: [TAO] from player name
✅ Player Name: Mars (from "#10435 [TAO] Mars")
```

## ⚙️ Next Steps

### 1. Install Tesseract OCR (Required!)

**Windows:**
```powershell
# Download from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
# Run installer, install to: C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR
# Verify:
tesseract --version
```

### 2. Integrate with Your Bot

Add to `integrations/integration_loader.py`:

```python
# Add imports
from discord_bot.core.engines.screenshot_processor import ScreenshotProcessor
from discord_bot.core.engines.ranking_storage_engine import RankingStorageEngine
from discord_bot.cogs.ranking_cog import setup as setup_ranking_cog

# In __init__, add:
self.ranking_processor = ScreenshotProcessor()
self.ranking_storage = RankingStorageEngine("event_rankings.db")

# In _mount_cogs, add:
await setup_ranking_cog(
    self.bot,
    processor=self.ranking_processor,
    storage=self.ranking_storage
)

# Update log message:
logger.info("⚙️ Mounted cogs: translation, admin, help, role_management, sos, easteregg, game, battle, ranking")
```

### 3. Test It!

```powershell
# Start bot
python main.py

# In Discord, use:
/games ranking submit
# Upload your Top Heroes screenshot
# Select day (1-5) and stage (Prep/War)
# Bot processes and confirms!
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Submit Your Ranking
```
/games ranking submit
  screenshot: [upload image]
  day: 1
  stage: Prep
```

Bot will show:
```
✅ Ranking Submitted!
Player: [TAO] Mars
Stage: Prep Stage
Day: Day 1 - Construction Day
Rank: #10,435
Score: 28,200,103 points
```

### View Your History
```
/games ranking view limit:10
```

Shows your last 10 submissions with ranks and scores.

### Guild Leaderboard
```
# All TAO members
/games ranking leaderboard

# Day 1 Construction only
/games ranking leaderboard day:1

# War Stage rankings
/games ranking leaderboard stage:War

# Specific filters
/games ranking leaderboard day:3 stage:War guild_tag:TAO
```

Displays top 20 with medals for top 3: 🥇🥈🥉

## 🗄️ Database

All rankings stored in `event_rankings.db`:

- **Tracks**: User ID, player name, guild tag, stage, day, rank, score, timestamp
- **History**: Full submission history per user
- **Analytics**: Submission stats, success/failure rates
- **Cleanup**: Auto-delete old rankings (30+ days)

## 🔒 Security Features

- Image validation (size, type, content)
- Rate limiting ready (use your existing security decorators!)
- Channel restrictions (respects ALLOWED_CHANNELS)
- Input validation on day/stage parameters

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Ready to Add)

- [ ] Manual data entry (backup for failed OCR)
- [ ] Edit/delete submissions
- [ ] Daily reminder to submit rankings
- [ ] Weekly ranking reports
- [ ] Progress tracking over time
- [ ] Achievement badges
- [ ] CSV export for guild leaders

## 📊 Example Command Flow

1. User takes screenshot of Top Heroes ranking
2. User runs `/games ranking submit`
3. Bot validates image
4. OCR extracts data (stage, day, rank, score, player name, guild tag)
5. Bot saves to database
6. Bot shows confirmation embed
7. Bot posts to bot channel (public announcement)
8. User can view history with `/games ranking view`
9. Guild can see leaderboard with `/games ranking leaderboard`

## 🎮 Commands Summary

| Command | Description | Parameters |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| `/games ranking submit` | Submit ranking screenshot | screenshot, day (1-5), stage (Prep/War) |
| `/games ranking view` | View your history | limit (optional, default 5) |
| `/games ranking leaderboard` | Guild rankings | day, stage, guild_tag (all optional) |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### OCR Not Working?
1. Install Tesseract: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
2. Verify: `tesseract --version`
3. If still failing, add to `screenshot_processor.py`:
   ```python
   pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'
   ```

### Can't Extract Data?
- Screenshot must be clear (not blurry)
- Must show stage buttons, day buttons, rank, score, player name
- Try better lighting/higher resolution
- Check bot logs for detailed errors

### Dependencies
```powershell
# Already installed:
pip list | findstr "Pillow pytesseract"

# Should show:
# Pillow       10.x.x
# pytesseract  0.3.x
```
