# FunBot
This bot contains all easter eggs, games, and fun commands/utilities from the HippoBot project.

## Running

```bash
python fun_bot/main.py
```

This entry point forces the `BOT_PROFILE=fun` mode, enabling only the game/event/ranking stack (admin/help support included for moderation). Supply `BOT_COGS` to override the exact cog list when experimenting locally.
