# Pokemon Battle System Documentation

## Overview
Complete turn-based Pokemon battle system matching official Pokemon game mechanics with type effectiveness, physical/special split, critical hits, and rewards.

---

## Battle Mechanics

### Turn Order
- **Speed Stat Determines First Turn** - Pokemon with higher speed attacks first
- **Turn-Based** - Players alternate turns until one Pokemon faints
- **No switching** - Single Pokemon battles (can be expanded later)

### Damage Calculation
Uses official Pokemon damage formula:

```python
# Level factor
level_factor = (2 * attacker_level / 5) + 2

# Base damage
damage = (level_factor * move_power * attack_stat) / defense_stat
damage = (damage / 50) + 2

# Type effectiveness (0x, 0.5x, 1x, 2x, 4x)
damage *= type_effectiveness_multiplier

# STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) - 1.5x
if move.type in attacker.types:
    damage *= 1.5

# Critical hit (6.25% chance) - 1.5x
if critical_hit:
    damage *= 1.5

# Random factor (85-100%)
damage *= random.uniform(0.85, 1.0)

# Minimum 1 damage
damage = max(1, int(damage))
```

### Type Effectiveness
Full 18-type chart implemented:
- **Super Effective (2x)** - "It's super effective!"
- **Not Very Effective (0.5x)** - "It's not very effective..."
- **Immune (0x)** - "It doesn't affect the foe..."
- **Normal (1x)** - Standard damage
- **Dual-type multipliers** - Can stack (e.g., 4x weakness)

### Physical vs Special Split
- **Physical Moves** - Use Attack vs Defense
- **Special Moves** - Use Special Attack vs Special Defense
- **Status Moves** - Deal no damage (future expansion)

### Move Accuracy
- Each move has accuracy rating (0-100%)
- Roll check before damage calculation
- Miss = 0 damage dealt

### Critical Hits
- 6.25% base chance (1/16)
- Deals 1.5x damage
- Message: "Critical hit!"

## Battle Rewards

### XP Rewards
Winning Pokemon gains experience based on:

**Base XP Formula:**
```python
base_xp = loser_level * 50

# Bonus for beating higher level Pokemon
if loser_level > winner_level:
    bonus = (loser_level - winner_level) * 10
    base_xp += bonus

# Minimum 50 XP
xp_reward = max(50, base_xp)
```

**Examples:**
- Beat same level (Lv.20 vs Lv.20): 1000 XP
- Beat higher level (Lv.15 vs Lv.20): 1000 + 50 = 1050 XP
- Beat lower level (Lv.25 vs Lv.10): 500 XP

### Cookie Rewards
Winner receives cookies based on difficulty:

**Cookie Formula:**
```python
base_cookies = random.randint(2, 4)

# Bonus for beating higher level
level_diff = loser_level - winner_level
if level_diff >= 5:
    base_cookies += 2
elif level_diff >= 10:
    base_cookies += 5

cookie_reward = base_cookies
```

**Examples:**
- Beat same level: 2-4 cookies
- Beat +5 levels higher: 4-6 cookies
- Beat +10 levels higher: 7-9 cookies
