# Channel Routing Configuration

## Overview
The bot now posts public announcements to your configured **BOT_CHANNEL** while still showing private results to users.

## What Posts to BOT_CHANNEL

### ‚úÖ Welcome Messages
- When the bot joins a server
- When new members join

### ‚úÖ Game Announcements
- **Pokemon Catches**: "@user just caught a Pikachu! (Lv.15)"

### ‚úÖ Leaderboards
- **Cookie Leaderboard**: `/leaderboard` shows top 10 cookie earners
- Posts to both the user (ephemeral) AND the bot channel (public)

## Configuration

Your `.env` file contains:
```env
BOT_CHANNEL_ID=1426291882438426715
GENERAL_CHANNEL_ID=1423024480799817881
MEMBERSHIP_CHANNEL_ID=1426291734996062440
```

### Channel Priority
The bot finds the announcement channel in this order:
1. **BOT_CHANNEL_ID** from .env (your configured channel)
2. Channel named "bot", "bots", "bot-commands", or "commands"
3. Server system channel
4. First available text channel with send permissions

## User Experience
