🧭 CURRENT ACTIVE ISSUES (AS OF NOW)

🧱 1. SOS Engine Infinite Loop
Symptom: Repeatedly sends DMs in Japanese to specific users (you + one other).
Trigger Condition: Users who previously activated SOS; occurs even with keyword removed.
Likely Cause:
- Stale cache or memory record (sos_active_users or keyword cache not cleared).
- Detached async task continuing in background.
- Cross-entanglement with Translation Engine carrying stale “ja” context.
Effect: Continuous or random SOS retriggers and DM spam.

🧩 2. Translation / Language Context Entanglement
Symptom: Translation Engine sends DMs in Japanese to users not assigned Japanese role.
Cause:
- Shared cache keys or context between SOS Engine and Translation Engine.
- Language context not cleared after SOS completes.
Effect: Misfired translations, wrong language output, residual “ja” mode for specific users.

🪞 3. Routing Logic Clarification
Intended Behavior:
- Game/fun commands usable anywhere except the bot channel.
- Bot posts results into bot channel.
- Translation works across all channels.
Status: Logic confirmed correct after clarification, no action needed unless reversed again.

🧠 4. Caching Persistence / Stale Data
Symptom: Removing trigger keywords doesn’t stop activation.
Cause:
- Cache or memory state not invalidated after configuration changes.
- Engine(s) not reloaded or refreshed after edits.
Effect: Stale triggers, phantom behaviors, inconsistent testing results.

⚙️ 5. Self-Trigger Residue (Previously Fixed but Monitor)
Old Bug: Bot reacted to its own SOS emoji, triggering SOS loop.
Current Risk:
- Event filtering may still miss secondary pathways (e.g., edited embeds, reposts).
- Should remain on monitoring list.

🧾 6. Diagnostic / Logging Gap
Observation: Difficult to confirm which engine (SOS vs Translation) fires first.
Need: Add unified logging or per-engine debug tags to trace event → cache → output path.

✅ SUMMARY OF PRIORITY FIXES
- Clear all SOS-related cache and memory state on completion.
- Namespace caches between Translation and SOS Engines.
- Add guard flags for async tasks to prevent infinite loops.
- Add diagnostic logging to trace triggers.
- Re-verify channel routing post-cleanup.

Solution Summary: 
consolidated all gaming aspects of the bot to the appropriate gaming storage engine and cache system.
Due to the cross entanglement of sos propmts and translation functions that were mean to send translated dms 
to users with assigned language roles I began realizing how much easier life would bave been if I made 2 
separate bots and realized the issue is most likely me trying to keep my cookie ranking data in my main storage and caching ststem
Added additional safe guards to sos to prevent random misfires and removed default sos key words that were use in earlier phases


Synopsis: here this debug session taught me the importance of seperation of concernces of intertwine systems in my project
