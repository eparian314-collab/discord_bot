üß≠ CURRENT ACTIVE ISSUES (AS OF NOW)

üß± 1. SOS Engine Infinite Loop
Symptom: Repeatedly sends DMs in Japanese to specific users (you + one other).
Trigger Condition: Users who previously activated SOS; occurs even with keyword removed.
Likely Cause:
- Stale cache or memory record (sos_active_users or keyword cache not cleared).
- Detached async task continuing in background.
- Cross-entanglement with Translation Engine carrying stale ‚Äúja‚Äù context.
Effect: Continuous or random SOS retriggers and DM spam.

üß© 2. Translation / Language Context Entanglement
Symptom: Translation Engine sends DMs in Japanese to users not assigned Japanese role.
Cause:
- Shared cache keys or context between SOS Engine and Translation Engine.
- Language context not cleared after SOS completes.
Effect: Misfired translations, wrong language output, residual ‚Äúja‚Äù mode for specific users.

ü™û 3. Routing Logic Clarification
Intended Behavior:
- Game/fun commands usable anywhere except the bot channel.
- Bot posts results into bot channel.
- Translation works across all channels.
Status: Logic confirmed correct after clarification, no action needed unless reversed again.

üß† 4. Caching Persistence / Stale Data
Symptom: Removing trigger keywords doesn‚Äôt stop activation.
Cause:
- Cache or memory state not invalidated after configuration changes.
- Engine(s) not reloaded or refreshed after edits.
Effect: Stale triggers, phantom behaviors, inconsistent testing results.

‚öôÔ∏è 5. Self-Trigger Residue (Previously Fixed but Monitor)
Old Bug: Bot reacted to its own SOS emoji, triggering SOS loop.
Current Risk:
- Event filtering may still miss secondary pathways (e.g., edited embeds, reposts).
- Should remain on monitoring list.

üßæ 6. Diagnostic / Logging Gap
Observation: Difficult to confirm which engine (SOS vs Translation) fires first.
Need: Add unified logging or per-engine debug tags to trace event ‚Üí cache ‚Üí output path.

‚úÖ SUMMARY OF PRIORITY FIXES
- Clear all SOS-related cache and memory state on completion.
- Namespace caches between Translation and SOS Engines.
- Add guard flags for async tasks to prevent infinite loops.
- Add diagnostic logging to trace triggers.
- Re-verify channel routing post-cleanup.
